### Practical Time Series Analysis

# A Project in Pairs

We would like to forecast the number of marriages, the number of divorces and the number of births in a city or a country.

* A Gather data for the number of marriages, the number of divorces and the number of
births in a city or a country during a period that you consider sufficient for forecasting.
* B Visualise the time series. Use time series decomposition to extract the trend and seasonal
components. Divide the data into train and test sets.
* C Fit a SARIMA model.
* D Could you think of external variables that have impact on any of the three series? Fit a
SARIMAX model.
* E Is there inter-dependance between any of these three time series? If not, try to find
another time series that is inter-dependant with the number of births, for example. Fit
a VARMAX model.
* F Choose and apply two baseline models.
* G Make forecasts and plot them.
* H Compare the performance of the developed models: baselines, SARIMA, SARIMAX and
VARMAX. Select an appropriate error metric.
* I Make conclusions.

Additional tasks:
* Including to model data from World Bank data
* Feature selection with Gradient Boosting and Granger Causality
